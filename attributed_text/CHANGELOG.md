## [0.4.4] - Feb, 2024
 * [FIX] - `toggleAttribution()` error with inline placeholders.

## [0.4.3] - Jan, 2024
 * [FIX] - Accessing individual characters in `AttributedText` no longer tries to access indices
           out of bounds.

## [0.4.2] - Jan, 2024
 * [FIX] - A few `AttributedText` methods weren't updated to account for full length with placeholders.

## [0.4.1] - Jan, 2024
 * [ADJUSTMENT] - Added a few queries for the character or the placeholder at a given text offset.

## [0.4.0] - Dec, 2024
 * [FEATURE] - Added support for placeholders in text, e.g., to render inline widgets.
 * [ADJUSTMENT] - Upgrade `logging` to `v1.3.0`.

## [0.3.3] - Aug, 2024
 * Package metadata update - no functional changes.

## [0.3.2] - June, 2024
 * [FIX] - Crash when adding attributions that overlap others - you can now control whether a new attribution overwrites conflicting spans when you add it.

## [0.3.1] - June, 2024
 * [FEATURE] - Added query `getAllAttributionsThroughout()` to `AttributedText`.
 * [FEATURE] - Added `copy()` to `AttributedText()`.

## [0.3.0] - Feb, 2024
 * [BREAKING] - `AttributedText` and `SpanRange` constructors now use positional parameters istead of named parameters.
 * [FIX] - `AttributedText` now supports differents links for different URLs in the same text blob - previously all links were sent to the same URL withing a single `AttributedText`.
 * [FIX] - `collapseSpans` now reports the correct ending index, which was previously off by one.
 * `AttributedText` now has a substring method and length property to avoid needing to access the inner `text` string.
 * `AttributionSpan` now has a `range` property to get a non-directional span of text.
 * `AttributedText` can visit and report attribution spans instead of just visiting individual attribution markers.
 * Added query methods:
   * `getAttributionSpans()`
   * `getAttributionSpansByFilter()`
 * `AttributedText` now allows you to `addAttribution()` without auto-merging with preceding and following attributions (#1198)

## [0.2.2] - May, 2023
Upgrade Dart constraints to explicitly include Dart 3. Make `markers` public on `AttributedSpans`.

## [0.2.1] - January, 2023
Add `getAttributedRange()`, which returns a range that includes a given set of attributions.

## [0.2.0] - July, 2022
BREAKING - Attributions in an `AttributedText` are now visited by a `AttributionVisitor` instead of a callback, and the visitor receives span markers in a more useful way.

## [0.1.3] - June 3, 2022
Changed the `meta` dependency to a version that's compatible with Flutter.

## [0.1.2] - June 2, 2022 (DEPRECATED)
Fixed a couple bugs related to merging attribution spans when adding new spans.

## [0.1.1] - April 4, 2022
Downgraded `collection` from `1.16.0` to `1.15.0` because `flutter_test` is pinned to `1.15.0`.

## [0.1.0] - April 2, 2022
The first release of attributed_text, which was extracted from super_editor.
