/// A rich text editor that displays a document in a single-column layout.
///
/// A [SuperEditor] brings together the key pieces needed to display a user-editable document:
///  * An editor, which includes a document and a composer (which holds the user selection and styles).
///  * A document layout, which positions components for every piece of content in the document.
///  * User interactions with the document layout (tapping, dragging, typing, scrolling)
///
/// A [SuperEditor] applies visual styles based on:
///  * [stylesheet], which applies styles throughout the document layout,
///    including text styles and block padding.
///  * [selectionStyles], which dictates the color of the caret and the color of
///    selected text and components
///  * [componentStyles], which applies targeted styles to specific components
///    in the document layout.
///  * [componentBuilders], which produce every visual component [Widget] within the document layout.
///
/// [keyboardActions] decides how physical keyboard key presses alter the document within
/// a [SuperEditor].
///
/// [imePolicies], [imeConfiguration], and [softwareKeyboardController] decide how user interactions
/// with the operating system's Input Method Editor (IME) alters the document within a
/// [SuperEditor].
///
/// ## Deeper explanation of core artifacts:
///
/// A [Document] is responsible for holding the content of a document in a structured
/// and query-able manner.
///
/// A [DocumentComposer] is responsible for holding the user's selection, as well as any inline
/// text styles that should be applied as the user types.
///
/// An [Editor] is responsible for executing every request that alters a [Document] or
/// [DocumentComposer]. The [Editor] provides hooks for reactions, which can further alter
/// content after a command, such as parsing inline Markdown, or creating hash tags. The
/// [Editor] implements undo/redo control.
///
/// A [DocumentLayout] is responsible for positioning and rendering the various visual
/// components in the document. It's also responsible for linking logical document nodes
/// to visual document components to facilitate user interactions like tapping and dragging.
///
/// Document interaction is responsible for taking appropriate actions in response to user
/// taps, drags, and key presses.
