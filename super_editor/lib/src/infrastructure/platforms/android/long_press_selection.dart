/// A strategy for selecting text during a long-press drag gesture, similar to
/// how the Android OS selects text during a long-press drag.
///
/// This strategy is made to operate over a document layout.
///
/// This strategy isn't identical to the Android OS behavior, but it's very similar.
///
/// Differences:
///
///   * Android lets the user collapse the initial word selection when selecting
///     in one direction, and then selecting in the other. This strategy always
///     keeps the initial word selection, regardless of whether the user initially
///     drags in one direction and then reverses back and crosses to the other
///     side of the initial word.
///
///   * Android selects a word when the user selects at least half way into the word.
///     This strategy selects the word as soon as the user selects any part of the
///     word.
///
///   * Android seems to maintain a virtual selection offset, which can be different
///     from the finger position. This is easy to see when the user initially selects
///     by word, and then reverses direction to select by character. The placement of
///     the virtual selection offset, as compared to the finger offset, is different
///     depending on whether the user is pulling back by character, or pushing forward
///     by character.
///
///       * This strategy attempts to match Android's virtual selection offset when the
///         user pulls back from per-word selection and begins per-character selection.
///
///       * When the user starts pushing forward again, after previously pulling back
///         for per-character selection, this strategy waits until the user exceeds
///         the current word boundary and then switches back to per-word selection.
///         This is different from Android, which applies some kind of heuristic to
///         begin pushing the selection forward before the user's finger reaches the
///         edge of the word.
///
